👩‍🎓 I am a Masters in Software Engineering student at Penn State University (December '25), learning to develop large, robust, and complex software systems.

💻 I also completed [Dev10's Java Developer Bootcamp](https://www.credly.com/badges/40b4b79c-cfac-4229-bf2f-82b6d473e562/public_url) (July '23) and FDM Group's Java Developer Track (February 2024), equiping me with in demand full-stack development skills.

👩‍💻 Currently, I work in fintech on a backend team at Prudential Financial (Fortune 500, ranked 81st), where I build reliable code to reinforce hydration processes.

Let's code the future together!
